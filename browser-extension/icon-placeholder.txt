Icon Placeholder

To complete the extension setup, you'll need to add icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple icons or use a placeholder image. The extension will work without custom icons, but Chrome will show a default icon.

For now, you can create simple colored squares or use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images and name them accordingly.
